# Terminus Math Puzzle Solver
A simple HTML page that allows users to quickly bypass the whiteboard puzzle in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.

<h2>Goal</h2>
In my OOP with Web Development class we have begun to work with HTML and Java, with plans for the first project in that class to involve making SQL queries via a Java applicaiton to a database. We have had some basic assignments to refamiliarize ourselves with the process
of creating a basic page and this inspired me to pursue something basic with real application. I had some inspiration to create this basic tool while playing the new Call of Duty. In the game's Zombies mode, there is a puzzle that requires the player to find symbols
that they can then use to translate into numbers and solve a few basic algebra problems. While the math itself is not challenging by any means, even for the average Call of Duty player, it can be hard to focus on translating the symbols into their appropriate values
using the whiteboard found in game while being overrun by zombies. My tool allows for players to quickly input the sequence of unique symbols for their specific instance of the game and transcibe them into the final result, letting them focus on keeping their team alive.

<h2>Implementation</h2>
Firstly, some context for the logic of the puzzle. There are 6 possible symbols of which the player will have three of them corespond to the values of x, y, and z variables. The symbols themselves are unique to every game played but they always represent the same numbers.
The player is supposed to look at a chart written on a whiteboard in the gameworld, and translate the symbols to numbers only to then have to mentally insert them into the three given equations to figure out the final combination. Bear in mind all of this has to be done
while fending off the infinitely spawning zombies. Instead of all this, my idea was simply to have the player insert their symbols into the page and quickly recieve the final combination, foregoing any mental number manipulation or math solving. Acting on my inspiration,
the current implementation has the symbols drawn up by myself in paint, a brief description, some buttons to handle submitting the symbols and clearing them, and a space to see the final combination. My focus here was entirely functional, and seeing as I have already used
the tool myself in game to great success, I would say I succedded there. However there is always room for imporvement and I could take this as an oppourtunity to improve my CSS skills whenever I see fit.

<h2>Reflection</h2>
This project was really fun for me as it was the purest form of raw inspiration. I was doing something I enjoyed, and identified a problem I could solve. This current implementation was just the project of an afternoon but I got to improve my skills in HTML, JavaScript
and CSS, and created something I could easily see myself using in the future.
